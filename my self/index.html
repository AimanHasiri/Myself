<font face="arial" color="red" size="+2">I</font> am turning 21 years old this year. I love to eat sambal udang and nasi ayam. I like to play computer games such as Dota 2, Valorant
Aim lab and F1 2020. During holiday me and my family will do some activities together such as gardening, chatting about my childhood memories. It's
kinda funny and cheering when my parents throwback about my past. Sometimes, I also love to list some music.. especially in pop and rock genre.
